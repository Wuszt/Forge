# Forge
Engine whose purpose is to create a sandbox for various algorithms.
#
### Goals:
- As less external code as possible (as long as it makes sense/it's not boring to implement).
- OOP and DOP hybrid - ECS where it makes sense.
- Long term project with slow, but constant progress.

#

Unit Tests have been moved to separate, private submodule. They're obviously not needed to run an application.
